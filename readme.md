## Seed generator for random function using generic hardware.

The RF 433 receiver captures any noise in its reception range, we can use these pulses to generate a random number.

(Just seeding the random function using the ADC read value without a signal generated by dedicated hardware may not be enough to produce a random initial value)

- Software
- - Read times between rising and falling edges
- - Perform simple average
- - Seed random value

- Hardware:
- - 1- RF 433 recetor ASK
- - 1- Analog input
- - 1- Resistor 10k (between receiver output and analog input)
   
## Serial Monitor output using this method:

- 06:07:55.480 -> random: 67
- 06:08:03.250 -> random: 44
- 06:08:09.750 -> random: 82
- 06:08:15.777 -> random: 67
- 06:08:21.647 -> random: 97
- 06:08:27.750 -> random: 67
- 06:08:35.715 -> random: 35

## Serial Monitor output without using this method::
- 06:13:51.300 -> random: 7
- 06:13:55.114 -> random: 7
- 06:13:59.659 -> random: 7
- 06:14:03.539 -> random: 7
- 06:14:07.154 -> random: 7
- 06:14:11.001 -> random: 7
